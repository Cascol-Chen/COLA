# Cross-Device Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation

This is the official project repository for Cross-Device Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation by Guohao Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Deyu Chen, Shuhai Zhang, Changsheng Li, Yuanqing Li and Mingkui Tan

* 1️⃣ CoLA conducts TTA in a multi-device collaborative manner. It enables knowledge accumulation, sharing, and exploitation across devices to boost adaptation efficiency and performance, while keeping privacy preserved and communication efficient.

* 2️⃣ CoLA devise two collaboration strategies (_BP-Based_ & _Forward-Only_) to address a practical scenario where multiple devices with different computational resources and latency requirements need to perform TTA simultaneously. Our CoLA paradigm is decentralized and flexible, which allows all agents to join or leave the collaboration at any time.
